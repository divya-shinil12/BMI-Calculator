#BMI Calculator 
I am excited to introduce my latest project: a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator is an web application created to assist users in determining their BMI using their height and weight. 
BMI calculates body fat based on a person's weight relative to their height. This tool is designed to promote health awareness, encouraging individuals to understand their BMI and take steps toward a healthier future.
This calculator helps the users to evaluate their body composition and find out if they fall into the underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese categories according to standard BMI classifications.

Explanation of code:
1. HTML (`index.html`) :  Provides the structure for the BMI calculator, including input fields for personal details, height and weight and 'Calculate BMI' button to calculate and display the result and 'clear' button to reset all the fields.
2. CSS (`styles.css`) : Styles the calculator for a clean, user-friendly interface.
3. JavaScript (`scripts.js`) : Handles the form submission, calculates the BMI, determines the BMI category and finally displaying the result.

**Key Features:**
1. **User-input :**  An easy-to-use BMI calculator that allows you to enter your personal details such as Salutation, Full name, Age, Height (in centimeters), weight (in kilogram). 
2. **BMI Calculation :** The application computes BMI using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m)) and the resulting value is then presented to the user.
3. **BMI Category :** Get instant feedback on your BMI category to see if you are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
4. **Responsive Design:** The web application is designed to be responsive, adjusting to various screen sizes and devices to provide an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
5. **Track Your Progress:** Monitor your BMI over time to keep an eye on your health and fitness journey.
6. **Attractive Layout Design:**  The user interface features a modern and clean design, creating a visually appealing experience that enhances overall usability.
